You will be required to add money to your BeachCard to enable printing in the labs.

Additional supplementary material outside of the class textbook will be presented and included in tests, learning activities and programming projects. Links to additional material will be posted on line.

Course Goals
Design an abstract class and an appropriate set of instantiable child classes to solve a software requirement.
Effectively use inheritance, interfaces, composition and delegation.
Effectively use Java Collections library
Effectively use Design Patterns to create software.
Effectively use try/catch/throw along with the Java Error Exception class hierarchy.
Design a class hierarchy of medium complexity (6-12 classes) to create a software solution for a non-trivial application.
Implement their class hierarchy to produce the software solution.
Provide Unit Tests
Cheating and Plagarism
Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. Any individual caught cheating on quizzes, homework, lab projects, or the final exam will be punished to the full extent allowed under University regulations.

Plagiarism on papers or assignments is not acceptable and work that is plagiarized will not receive credit. Plagiarism is considered cheating.
Note: Any time another person’s work is used without giving them proper credit, it is considered plagiarism and cheating. At a minimum, any student caught cheating will receive no credit for the work concerned, and will receive a reduction of one letter grade from their final course grade.

Ethics
All assignments are to be worked in pairs of students. I do encourage you discuss your ideas and help each other. But any assignment turned in must be your own individual group's work. Any form of plagiarism or cheating -- including copying from someone else, cheating on an exam, turning someone else's work in as your own, and so on -- will result in a failing grade on the assignment (at a minimum), and could result in a failing grade in the course or even university disciplinary action.
Also see the CSULB campus-wide computer use policy for more information. When in doubt, ask.

Attendance, due dates, adds, and drops:
Attendance is required in lecture and lab(just like a job).

Programming projects are due at the start of the lecture period on the dates shown in the schedule. Lab assignments are due at the end of the lab period on the dates shown in the schedule. See grading page for more information.

If you want to add this class, you must attend the first day of class and fill out a request form. Please do not attempt to add the course (or enroll in it prior to the semester) if you have not completed the prerequisite courses.

I will normally honor drop requests where permitted by University policy.

Reasonable Accommodation:
Individuals with disabilities who need assistance or modification to the University’s programs and/or activities should inform the person(s) responsible for these programs and/or activities immediately upon knowing that such modification is necessary. Students with a disability or medical restriction who are requesting a classroom accommodation should contact the Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC)at 562-985-5401 or visit SSC, room 110 during 8AM-5PM weekday hours. BMAC will work with the student to identify a reasonable accommodation in partnership with appropriate academic offices and medical providers.
Reach out to BMAC as soon as possible. It is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor in advance of the need for accommodations of a university verified disability.
